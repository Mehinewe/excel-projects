# Excel-projects
This repository contains my **data analysis projects built using Microsoft Excel**.

Each project focuses on applying real-world data analysis skills such as:

* Data cleaning and preparation

* Data transformation

* Pivot tables and formulas

* KPI analysis

* Dashboard creation and reporting

The datasets are designed to reflect **realistic business scenarios** (HR, training, performance, operations, etc.) and demonstrate my ability to turn raw, messy data into **clear insights and decision-ready dashboards**.

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

* Excel data cleaning (handling inconsistencies, formats, missing values)

* Lookup functions (VLOOKUP / XLOOKUP, INDEX MATCH)

* Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts

* Conditional formatting

Business-oriented analysis and insights
