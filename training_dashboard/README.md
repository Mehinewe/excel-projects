In this project, I transformed raw HR and training data into a clean, structured, and interactive dashboard using Microsoft Excel. 
I converted datasets into named tables, standardized formats (text, dates, numbers), corrected employee IDs, and applied data validation 
to ensure consistency and data quality. I used formulas such as **DATEDIF** to calculate employee age, **TRIM** for data cleaning, and **VLOOKUP**
to enrich datasets with employee names and departments.

I also built dynamic **Pivot Table**s and **Pivot Charts**, added relationships through the Data Model, and created an **interactive dashboard 
using slicers and timelines**. **Conditional formatting** was applied to highlight key insights, such as low and high satisfaction scores. 
This project demonstrates my ability to clean data, enforce data integrity, analyze datasets, and present insights clearly 
through interactive Excel dashboards.
